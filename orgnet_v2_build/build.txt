Building from CookieCutter Template: 
[AT SOME POINT AUTOMATE THIS INTO A SCRIPT]

1. Create a new python environment utilizing pyenv 
    - pyenv virtualenv 3.4.0 venv

2. Install needed packages via pip
    -pip install Torch=1.5.1
    -pip install pandas

3. Create a repo on github and clone it into folder on the local machine
    -git clone xx.github.com
    or for an existing folder
        1. git init 
        2. git add . 
        3. git commit -m "first commit"
        4. git remote add origin https://github.com/greglee1905/orgnet_v2.git
        5. git remote -v
        6. git push -u origin master 

4. Create the cookie cutter template 
    - cookiecutter https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science 

5. pip freeze to view and all requirements to requirements.txt 
6. make requirements to ensure all packages are installed and ready to go
7. Connecting to aws services: 
    - Create AWS ID and secret 
    - region name: us-west-1
    - output json  [UNSURE IF THIS CORRECT OR NOT]
8. So far it seems that these secrets are held within the terminal. Not sure if they need to be within the env file.
